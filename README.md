# SnakeGameWithAI
Need: Python3,Keras,Pygame

'''

I added my model that works not too bad
Don't believe my model and make it yourself.(sry...)
As you can see in the code it takes a while to collect the state. So don't rush and wait for few days.

'''

SnakeGameWithAI -> run.py -> if you want to load the model just type yes. Else just press enter to go.
Copy the model from your folder and paste to the test folder. And run!
